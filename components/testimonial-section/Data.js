      "We stayed at this place as an day outing. This place is just 5 kms far from Bannerghatta Biological Park. It feels like we lived in the heart of nature :) Awesome place for a pleasant stay. My family members had an great day at this place. We would love to choose this place once again for our holiday!",

      "We organized our son's birthday party here and it was well organized. The venue - Mexican hut was perfect setting for about 100 guests. The lawn was reasonably maintained, The facilities were really nice. The food was good too. But I am giving 4 stars only because we paid for the food for 100 people and resort staff were very frugal in giving the left over food. They wanted to use the food that we paid for the buffet instead, which was awkward. The amenities are good - swimming pool, basket ball court, ping pong and carrom. Large space to roam around",
